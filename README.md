Pixel Sprite Generator
======================

OCaml implementation of a procedural pixel sprite generator similar to the old days of video game sprites. The sprites are algorithmically generated by combinatorial methods.

## Original Project

The original version was written in Javascript:
- [pixel-sprite-generator](https://github.com/zfedoran/pixel-sprite-generator) port by [Zelimir Fedoran](https://github.com/zfedoran)


## Algorithm

The sprites are generated by using a two dimensional mask. The values in the mask are then randomized and mirrored.

The algorithm is explained in more detail on [Dave Bollinger's](http://web.archive.org/web/20080228054410/http://www.davebollinger.com/works/pixelspaceships/) website.
